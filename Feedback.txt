-mechanical design of scale (Khavish) - try different designs and see which one gives the best results
-battery monitoring, 5V regulator cheaper + testing procedures for PCB
-casing of pcb + batteries + micro
	-insulated wooden box
-mAh needed for raspberry pi
-better communication between submodules
-move off whatsapp group and start talking on teams
----------
-how does each submodule interface with other submodules?

What you considered, why you considered it
Choices that you've made
Document all design choices for report

-load cell is temp dependent
-need temperature sensor for calibration purposes (?)

-Pi 0 vs ESP32 - S

18650 batteries 
-charging circuitry
-no over discharging
-battery temperature monitoring

-ask Ben if he wants to use PC or mobile for connection

-humidity/temperature/light (ask Ben) (possibly internal and external)

-measure power draw of Pi vs ESP32

-place to name bird

Charger Circuitry
- Buying a charger vs designing one using a charging IC (TP4056) and implementing protection circuitry
- Might be cheaper to just buy a charger
- Less risk of it not working
- Less involved

-made the charging circuitry
-included a microUSB and USB type C adapter
-TP4056 has overcharge protection (when the charging current .... stops charging)
-for type c connection

Battery levels
- Input: 2*3.7V = 7.4V (18650 Lithium Ions)
- Two batteries in parallel (3V to 4.2V) (2000mAh capacity * 2)
- Use a boost converter to get 5V output instead of a linear regulator
- linear regulator to get 3v3 output from 5V

Battery Protection (Under/Over Voltage Protection)
-https://forum.digikey.com/t/simple-undervoltage-and-overcurrent-protection-for-lithium-ion-and-lithium-polymer-batteries/13123
-Found this https://datasheet.lcsc.com/lcsc/2208151830_Microchip-Tech-TC54VC3002ECB713_C626560.pdf 
which will force the output to logic low (off) when the input voltage drops below a predetermined value
-Included a male header pins to bypass undervoltage protection, incase it doesn't work

-have a switching circuit which I got from here https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/Appnotes/01149c.pdf
which is comes just after the Vusb/Bat+

PCB
-ask Justin about best way to populate to have two 18650s on board
-ask Justin the best way to supply power to load cells and HX711

Voltage regulator
-determine how much current we need worst case
-5V regulator chose 500mA because uC will use max 400mA and HX711 uses about 2mA
-3.3V regulator only needs to supply sensors so 100mA is more than enough
-Regulate 3V3 from the 5V regulated output -> provides the over voltage protection (5V max input is 18V) and less waste due to heat

Temperature Sensors

C2827328
No sleep mode/ not as much information on power consumption + highest power consumption

- https://datasheet.lcsc.com/lcsc/2106070104_Sensirion-SHT30-DIS-B10KS_C2687423.pdf
C2687423 *****
Better power consumption v above, but no sleep mode
Package type has more temp/humidity sensors also in stock of similar price should this one not be in stock (at least two alternative with >4000 in stock)

- file:///C:/Users/sarah/Downloads/SHTC3-10000.pdf
C2880044
Has sleep mode + good power consumption
Only one other temp/humidity sensor of same package type available of JLC (and the alternative has <10 in stock at time of writing this)
